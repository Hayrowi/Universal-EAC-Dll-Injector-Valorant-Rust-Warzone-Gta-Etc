**Be careful when purchasing hacking cheats to avoid scams. More projects to come.**

- **Should you be interested, feel free to fork this repository and initiate a pull request to contribute your own module. A crucial initial consideration is the "MAIN" function; it's essential for the successful execution of any module within the DLL. The "MAIN" function requires only one mandatory argument: the HINSTANCE of the DLL. While you can choose to disregard it, keep in mind that it is necessary for utilizing WinAPI functions and performing various tasks. Remember that it's imperative to include "windows.h" in the module to access the definition of HINSTANCE within the "MAIN" function.**
